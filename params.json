{"name":"Atria","tagline":"A toolkit for modern C++ development","body":"Atria\r\n=====\r\n\r\n*Atria is a toolkit for modern C++ development*.\r\n\r\nIt provides core components that extend the standard library\r\ncapabilities.  It provide (mostly) header-only libraries of general\r\ninterest, in the spirit of the STL, Boost, Adobe Source Libraries or\r\nFacebook's Folly and Fatal.\r\n\r\nThis is an **open source** project.  You are encouraged you to use it,\r\nmodify it and redistribute it.\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n------\r\n\r\nAtria is written in **standard C++11** and compile with recent\r\nversions of GCC and Clang.\r\n\r\nThis project is under active development and it's API is not stable\r\nyet.  Thus it is not suitable for most production systems.  However it\r\nis thoroughly tested, and **we encourage you to try it**.  Your\r\nfeedback is very wellcome.\r\n\r\n## Modules\r\n\r\n* `atria::prelude` provides basic functional programming tools in the\r\n  spirit of those in Clojure `core` and Haskell's `Prelude`.\r\n\r\n* `atria::variant` provides tools for better usability of\r\n  [Boost.Variant](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/variant.html)\r\n  and [Eggs.Variant](http://eggs-cpp.github.io/variant/) and is\r\n  customizable to other sum type implementatios.\r\n\r\n* `atria::meta` provides several metaprogramming tools, including some\r\n  [Booost.MPL](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/mpl/doc/index.html)\r\n  adaptors for several variadic types and concept checking facilities.\r\n\r\n* `atria::estd` provides C++11 compatible implementations of some\r\n  C++14 and beyond standard library components.\r\n\r\n* `atria::xform` provides an efficient C++ implementation of\r\n  transducers, a concept introduced in\r\n  [Clojure](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming)\r\n  by Rich Hickie.\r\n\r\n* `atria::funken` provides a *experimental* library for writing epochal\r\n  and functional data-models.\r\n\r\n* `atria::testing` provides testing tools and frameworks for writing\r\n  spies, mocks, micro-benchmarks and more.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n**Reference documentation**\r\n[can be browsed here](http://abletonag.github.io/atria/reference).\r\n\r\nIt can be generated by executing in the project directory: `doxygen doxy/doxygen.config`\r\n\r\n### Talks\r\n\r\n- [We will talk about parts of the library in CppCon 2015](\r\nhttp://cppcon2015.sched.org/event/ff8f576d5d0fe02bcc05fccfa56359a3)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n  - [boost](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0)\r\n  - [googletest](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/googletest) (for testing only)\r\n\r\nOther dependencies are vendored via submodules.  Make sure to run `git\r\nsubmodules update --init --recursive` before building.\r\n\r\n## Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Juan Pedro BolÃ­var Puente ([\\@jbo-ableton](https://github.com/jbo-ableton))\r\n- Brent Shields ([\\@brs-ableton](https://github.com/brs-ableton))\r\n- Tobias Hahn ([\\@toh-ableton](https://github.com/toh-ableton))\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n**Atria** is distributed under the MIT license (see LICENSE).\r\n\r\n> Copyright (c) 2014, 2015 Ableton AG, Berlin\r\n>\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n>\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n>\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n> IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
