Atria
=====

*Atria is a toolkit for modern C++ development*.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ableton/atria.svg?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/Ableton/atria)

It provides core components that extend the standard library
capabilities.  It provides various libraries of general interest, in
the spirit of the STL, Boost, Adobe Source Libraries, or Facebook's
Folly and Fatal.

This is an **open source** project.  You're encouraged to use it,
modify it, and redistribute it.

Status
------

Atria is written in **standard C++11** and compiles with recent
versions of GCC and Clang.

This project is under active development and its API is not stable
yet.  Thus it is not suitable for most production systems.  However it
is thoroughly tested, and **we encourage you to try it**.  Your
feedback is very welcome.

## Modules

* `atria::prelude` provides basic functional programming tools in the
  spirit of those in Clojure `core` and Haskell's `Prelude`.

* `atria::variant` provides tools for better usability of
  [Boost.Variant](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/variant.html)
  and [Eggs.Variant](http://eggs-cpp.github.io/variant/) and is
  customizable to other sum type implementations.

* `atria::meta` provides several metaprogramming tools, including some
  [Boost.MPL](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/mpl/doc/index.html)
  adaptors for several variadic types and concept checking facilities.

* `atria::estd` provides C++11 compatible implementations of some
  C++14 and beyond standard library components.

* `atria::xform` provides an efficient C++ implementation of
  transducers, a concept introduced in
  [Clojure](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming)
  by Rich Hickey.

* `atria::funken` provides a *experimental* library for writing epochal
  and functional data-models.

* `atria::testing` provides testing tools and frameworks for writing
  spies, mocks, micro-benchmarks and more.
