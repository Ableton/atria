/*!

  C++ amazing templates and reusable implementations awesomeness.
  Extends standard library capabilities and provide mostly header-only
  libraries in the spirit of the STL, Boost, Adobe Source Libraries or
  Facebook's Folly and Fatal.

  The library is written in C++11.  In the spirit of using modern C++

  up.
